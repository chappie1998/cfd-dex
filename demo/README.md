## Deployments

For instructions on how to deploy the contracts and the front-end on a local development environment, as well as various testnets check [here](../HOWTO.md).

Most testnets lack the desired Chainlink price feed oracles. Also, it is hard to get large amounts of USDC on testnets for experimentation. To mitigate these problems we have created the following:
- A mock USD (IERC20 + "mint(uint256)") token with symbol MUSD. Anyone can call the method "mint(uint256 amount)" on the contract to mint any amount of MUSD (up to $2^{50}$). 
- A mock Chainlink-compatible (AggregatorV3Interface) oracle, which delivers a fixed price for CNY/USD. In order to experiment with the price dynamics, the contract CFDOrderBook provides a method "setMockPrice(uint256 price)" which can be called by anyone to set the oracle price to any value (in 8 decimal places). To reset it to the default value, call "setMockPrice(0)". 

The contract calls can be conveniently executed from the appropriate blockchain explorer.

This is how all the testned deployments look after connecting with a wallet:

Here are the deployed contract addresses (no, it's not a mistake that they are the same on different blockchains - I am using the same addresses, signatures and sequence of deployment):
